# StopUnderThinking

A web application for journaling and note-taking.

## Purpose

StopUnderThinking digitises the process of note-taking and journaling, to allow personal notes to accessible anywhere with a device and an internet connection. In addition, the data is stored more robustly than paper which can be lost and damaged easily.

There are many incredible note taking applications such as Notion and OneNote, which StopUnderThinking cannot compete with in terms of features and capability. However, for those that are less technologically minded, Notion and OneNote can be intimidating! StopUnderThinking selling point is that it's a simple application with an intuitive user interface that can be understood by the masses. Furthermore, it is an open source project that is freely available for anyone to use.
